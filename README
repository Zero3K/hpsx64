*** HPS1x64 Instructions ***
----------------------------

To run bios dumped from a Playstation system:
Use File | Load | Bios to load a bios dump. Use File | Run to run a bios dump after loading it.

To run Playstation formatted game discs:
Can run bin/img/iso images with cue, ccd, and sub support.
To run a disc image, use File | Load | Bios to load a bios, then use File | Load | Insert/Remove Game Disk to load a game disk image (bin/img/iso/etc), then File | Run to run it.
Make sure that cue/ccd/sub files have the same name as the disk image and are in the same folder, or they will not load.

To change disks:
If a disk image is loaded, you will see a check mark next to the File | Load | Insert/Remove Game Disk option.
To remove the disk image, select the option again, and then you will see the check mark disappear. You can now load a new disk via the same option.

To load a save state:
First load the disk image, then load the save state, then use File | Run.

To switch between R3000A recompiler/interpreter:
You can choose to use the interpreter via CPU | CPU: R3000A | Interpreter: R3000A.
You can choose to use the recompiler via CPU | CPU: R3000A | Recompiler: R3000A.

Keys:
Use Peripherals | Configure Joystick... and then follow the instructions to configure a compatible dual analog game pad.
Note: If controller was inserted after program was started, then redetect pads (Peripherals->Re-Detect Joypad(s)).
Note: If the keys don't work for a title, then toggle analog/digital mode (Peripherals->Pad 1->Pad 1 Digital/Analog).

Troubleshooting:
If controls are not working properly, then try switching between digital/analog mode (for both pads if needed). Pads are set to analog by default for compatibility.
If a game does not load properly, try deleting/moving the memory card files.

Misc Credits/Disclaimer:
Currently only the MDEC backend is currently adapted from mame/mess/etc and is not currently entirely custom designed/coded by me.


*** HPS2x64 Instructions ***
----------------------------

To run bios dumped from a Playstation 2 system:
Use File | Load | Bios to load a bios dump. Use File | Run to run a bios dump after loading it.

To run Playstation 2 formatted game discs:
Can run bin/iso images.
To run a disc image, use File | Load | Bios to load a bios, then use File | Load | Insert/Remove PS2 Game Disk to load a PS2 game disk image (bin/img/iso), then File | Run to run it.
Make sure that cue files have the same name as the disk image and are in the same folder, or they will not load.
note: audio is delayed a few seconds by default. You can change the size of the audio buffer via Audio | Buffer Size.

To load a save state:
First load the disk image, then load the save state, then use File | Run.

To switch between R3000A recompiler/interpreter:
You can choose to use the interpreter via CPU | CPU: R3000A | Interpreter: R3000A.
You can choose to use the recompiler via CPU | CPU: R3000A | Recompiler: R3000A.

To switch between R5900 recompiler/interpreter:
You can choose to use the interpreter via CPU | CPU: R5900 | Interpreter: R5900.
You can choose to use the recompiler via CPU | CPU: R5900 | Recompiler: R5900.

Troubleshooting:
If a game disk loads improperly, ensure that it has been dumped properly from the original physical game disk. Pads are set to DualShock2 by default for compatibility.
This program is WIP and for testing only.

Misc Credits/Disclaimer:
Currently only the IPU backend is currently adapted from pcsx2 and is not currently entirely custom designed/coded by me.


Build/Debug instructions:

1. The Microsoft Visual Studio Solution file "hpsx64.sln" is included. Open the file in Visual Studio.
2. Make sure you are in the x64 Release configuration for normal play testing. Only use x64 Debug for debugging certain code issues.

For hps1x64.exe (PS1 simulator) -
3. In the x64 Release configuration, after opening hpsx64.sln just right-click on hps1x64 and choose "Build" in Visual Studio.

For hps2x64.exe (PS2 simulator) -
3. In the x64 Release configuration, after opening hpsx64.sln just right-click on hps2x64 and choose "Build" in Visual Studio.

Note: A version of hps1x64.exe and hps2x64.exe should have been built for you already and should be in the same folder as this README file. For test/evaluate ONLY.
